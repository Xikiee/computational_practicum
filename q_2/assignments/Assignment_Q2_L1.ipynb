    "- Do not add, delete or create cells, write the answer only in the space marked with the three dots (`...`). Where function skeletons are provided, it is assumed that that function can be called again with different inputs somewhere else. So be careful to write code outside of functions.\n",
    "  - Function should be ['pure'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), thus no side effects, unless otherwise specified.\n",
    "- Run the the first cell to import all libraries when opening the notebook before running your own code.\n",
    "- Read carefully what is required to be printed/returned/plotted in the answer. Please do not output what is not asked for. \n",
    "  - If you used the print function for debugging, comment it out ( Ctlr + / ) before submitting\n",
    "- All plots should have title, xlabel, ylabel, and legend (if there are more than one curve on the plot)\n",
    "- Use the `help()` function, consult python documentation when using new functions, or do a web search and consult [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python)\n",
    "- Please read the error messages if you get any, and try to understand what they mean. Debugging code is an essential skill to develop.\n",
    "- You can use `%debug` to start an IPython console in a cell (or a scratchpad cell!) after an exception has occurred to try to debug.\n",
    "- You can use `%pdb` to toggle the Python DeBugger (pdb) auto start after an unhandled exception.\n",
    "- In the assignments you will find some tests put in place, to help you verify your solution. If these fail you are certain you did something wrong, thus look at the hints they provide. But passing these tests does __not__ mean your solution is actually correct.\n",

    "### Question 1: Defining classes\n",
    "The Antoine equation is a mathematical expression used to describe the relationship between the vapor pressure of a pure substance and its temperature. It is commonly used in thermodynamics and chemical engineering to estimate the vapor pressure of liquids. Vapor pressures are crucial to calculate vapor-liquid equilibria, and therefore lie at the heart of many chemical engineering and process design problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Antoine equation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\log_{10} P_{vap}(T) = A - \\frac{B}{C + T} $\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ P_{vap} $ is the vapor pressure of the substance in mmHg.\n",
    "- $ T $ is the temperature of the substance in °C.\n",
    "- $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $ are substance-specific empirical constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first assignment of Q1, we used this equation to calculate several different vapor pressures for water. However, most chemical engineering design problems invlove multiple components with different thermodynamic properties. In our process of interest, we now also need to calculate the vapor pressures for methanol and ethanol.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to keep track of all these Antoine-parameters in a simple script, our code is at high risk of becoming unreadable, unstructured, prone to errors, and messy. We want to manage this by writing a class called `AntoineComponent`, which encapsulates the Antoine parameters and the temperature validity domain for a chemical component. Implement this class below by following these steps:\n",
    "- Declare the class `AntoineComponent`.\n",
    "- Implement the constructor, that takes the following arguments: `(A: float, B: float, C: float, T_min: float, T_max: float)`. All arguments of the constructor are to be stored as attributes of the class.\n",
    "- Implement a method `calculate_vapor_pressure`, which takes only (!) the temperature as an input. Use the antoine parameters that are stored in the attributes for calculation.\n",
    "- Implement a mechanism in `calculate_vapor_pressure` that returns `-1` when the temperature argument is outside the component's validity domain."

    "### Question 4: Single-responsibility principle\n",
    "The function `vapor_fraction` is in clear violation of the single-responsibility principle. It calculates both the vapor pressure with Antoine's equation and the vapor fraction with Raoult's law. Now, it is not possible to use the functionality apart from each other, and it is harder to identify which part of the code does what.\n",

    "Rewrite the function `vapor_fraction` and split up the functionality into smaller code elements.  Feel free to make use of your class `AntoineComponent` from question 1, or write new functions or classes. Because the function may already be used by other parts of code, make sure that the function header remains the same.\n",

    "### Question 5: Object-oriented programming in practice\n",
    "In practice, it takes some experience to know what data entities to model as classes or objects in object-oriented programming. Often, it depends on requirements and what you want to do. Therefore, it helps to think about this in the context of chemical engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a list of concepts from chemical engineering. \n",
    "- A heat exchanger\n",
    "- A temperature measurement (So, a single measurement of temperature at a given location at a specified time)\n",
    "- A chemical reaction\n",
    "- A flowrate in kmol/hr in a pipe\n",
    "- A permeability coefficient in a membrane unit\n",
    "- The anode material in an electrolyzer\n",
    "- A process flow diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the concepts, discuss the questions below. Feel free to exchange your ideas with a colleague:\n",
    "- Would you model this as a class and with objects? Why (not)?\n",
    "- What would this class need to store as attributes? Would these be basic data types like floats and strings? Would they be numpy arrays? Or maybe even objects of another class? Which of the attributes are only used internally by methods in the class (private attributes), and which should be accessible from outside the class (public attributes/properties)?\n",
    "- What would you want your class to be able to do? What should it calculate? Which of these calculations are only used internally by other methods in the class (private methods), and which should be called from outside the class (public methods)?\n",
    "- Can you think of how the answer to the above questions might change with the context? E.g. if you are tasked to write a simple process simulation program vs. an automatic cost estimation program?"

    "### Bonus Question: Sick of jupyter notebook? Making a small graphical interface with Streamlit.\n",
    "Python offers several packages for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs). These GUIs make applications more intuitive and user-friendly by allowing users to interact with them visually rather than through code. A popular library for this is Streamlit, which excels at easily and quickly making interactive web apps for data science and machine learning projects. It transforms Python scripts into shareable web applications with a simple, intuitive API for displaying data, visualizations, and user inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a small application for Antoine data in Streamlit. You could include a feature that calculates vapor pressure at the click of a button, or directly plots the vapor pressure over a temperature range. Here is some helpful material to get you started:\n",
    "- [An excellent youtube tutorial with the basics of streamlit and how to build your first application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0D4Pa22iG0&t=41s)\n",
    "- [The streamlit documentation page with more detailed setup instructions and description of the streamlit functionality](https://docs.streamlit.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Streamlit does not work well from a jupyter notebook. We recommend to set this up in a separate Python project, copy over the code from this assignment into Python modules, and build your streamlit application there!"

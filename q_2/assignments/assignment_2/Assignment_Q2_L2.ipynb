    "- Run the the first cell to import all libraries when opening the notebook before running your own code.\n",
    "- Read carefully what is required to be printed/returned/plotted in the answer. Please do not output what is not asked for. \n",
    "  - If you used the print function for debugging, comment it out ( Ctlr + / ) before submitting\n",
    "- All plots should have title, xlabel, ylabel, and legend (if there are more than one curve on the plot)\n",
    "- Use the `help()` function, consult python documentation when using new functions, or do a web search and consult [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python)\n",
    "- Please read the error messages if you get any, and try to understand what they mean. Debugging code is an essential skill to develop.\n",
    "- You can use `%debug` to start an IPython console in a cell (or a scratchpad cell!) after an exception has occurred to try to debug.\n",
    "- You can use `%pdb` to toggle the Python DeBugger (pdb) auto start after an unhandled exception.\n",
    "- In the assignments you will find some tests put in place, to help you verify your solution. If these fail you are certain you did something wrong, thus look at the hints they provide. But passing these tests does __not__ mean your solution is actually correct.\n",

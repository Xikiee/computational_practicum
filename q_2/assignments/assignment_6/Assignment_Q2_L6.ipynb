    "- Do not add, delete or create cells, write the answer only in the space marked with the three dots (`...`). Where function skeletons are provided, it is assumed that that function can be called again with different inputs somewhere else. So be careful to write code outside of functions.\n",
    "  - Function should be ['pure'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), thus no side effects, unless otherwise specified.\n",
    "- Run the the first cell to import all libraries when opening the notebook before running your own code.\n",
    "- Read carefully what is required to be printed/returned/plotted in the answer. Please do not output what is not asked for. \n",
    "  - If you used the print function for debugging, comment it out ( Ctlr + / ) before submitting\n",
    "- All plots should have title, xlabel, ylabel, and legend (if there are more than one curve on the plot)\n",
    "- Use the `help()` function, consult python documentation when using new functions, or do a web search and consult [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python)\n",
    "- Please read the error messages if you get any, and try to understand what they mean. Debugging code is an essential skill to develop.\n",
    "- You can use `%debug` to start an IPython console in a cell (or a scratchpad cell!) after an exception has occurred to try to debug.\n",
    "- You can use `%pdb` to toggle the Python DeBugger (pdb) auto start after an unhandled exception.\n",
    "- In the assignments you will find some tests put in place, to help you verify your solution. If these fail you are certain you did something wrong, thus look at the hints they provide. But passing these tests does __not__ mean your solution is actually correct.\n",

    "*Scenario 1*: You measure the concentration of a chemical species over time using a sensor that introduces moderate noise. The true concentration–time relationship is unknown, but you need a smooth curve that captures overall trends without following noise too closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Scenario 2*: You collect vapor-pressure data across a wide temperature range. A known physical model such as the Antoine equation is available, but your experimental points include noise and are sparsely sampled at low temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Scenario 3*: You measure output voltage as a function of known electrolyte concentration. The data are nearly noise-free and lie very close to a smooth curve. You must predict intermediate values precisely, there is no need not extrapolate.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Scenario 4*: You measure the position of a vibrating mechanical system with high-frequency oscillations. You want to extract an approximate curve, not fit every oscillation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Scenario 5*: You have measurements of temperature in a reactor taken at irregular time intervals with gaps of 30–60 minutes. You need reliable predictions between measurements and controlled behavior when extrapolating slightly beyond the data."
